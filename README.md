Robotic System: This section of the code manages the robotic arm's operations. It forks a child process for image processing, ensuring that the parent process waits for this task to complete before moving the arm.

Smart Home Security: The code checks if the security system is armed and if the door is opened. If both conditions are true, it forks another child process to send a notification while the parent process sounds an alarm.

Smart Thermostat: Finally, the smart thermostat section starts by forking a child process to execute a plugin for temperature management. The parent process manages the temperature while waiting for the plugin to finish executing.
